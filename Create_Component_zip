1.	Make a copy of the skeleton directory and rename it to the same name as the component you created.
2.	Modify the 'run' file in that directory to reflect the correct number of input,parameter and output for the component 
		in the the following line where it has '1' for all three.
	. $BASEDIR/io.sh 1 1 1 "$@"
3.	Go to the next line of where it says "## for example:" and enter the appropriate execution commands for the component. 
4.	Save the file and then delete all the temporary files that were created in that directory due to editing of the files
		which end with '~'
5.	Go to the parent directory by "cd .."
6.	Create the zip file by "zip -r [component_name.zip] [component_name]/*"
	This will zip all the files in the directory named the same as the component recursively and create a zip file of the 
	same name with .zip extension.
7.	Test the zip file by copying it into any test directory and inflating/extracting it with the following command.
	"unzip [component_name.zip]". A directory should be created with the same name as [component_name] which will contain 
	the two files "io.sh" and "run".
